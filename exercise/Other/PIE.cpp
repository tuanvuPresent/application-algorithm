/*
My birthday is coming up and traditionally I'm serving pie.
Not just one pie, no, I have a number N of them, of various tastes and of
various sizes. F of my friends are coming to my party and each of them gets a
piece of pie. This should be one piece of one pie, not several small pieces
since that looks messy. This piece can be one whole pie though. My friends are
very annoying and if one of them gets a bigger piece than the others, they start
complaining. Therefore all of them should get equally sized (but not necessarily
equally shaped) pieces, even if this leads to some pie getting spoiled (which is
better than spoiling the party). Of course, I want a piece of pie for myself
too, and that piece should also be of the same size. What is the largest
possible piece size all of us can get? All the pies are cylindrical in shape and
they all have the same height 1, but the radii of the pies can be different.

Input
One line with a positive integer: the number of test cases. Then for each test
case:

One line with two integers N and F with 1F=N,F=10000: the number of pies and the
number of friends. One line with NN integers riri with 1 <= ri <= 10000: the
radii of the pies. Output For each test case, output one line with the largest
possible volume VV such that me and my friends can all get a pie piece of size
VV. The answer should be given as a floating point number rounding to 6 digits
after the floating point.
